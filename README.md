# Isomorphic 𝚫 now client

This is currently a **fork** of the [now-client](https://github.com/zeit/now-client) with the intention of being able to be run in both node and the browser (and adds more semicolons).

```sh
$ npm install --save now-client-isomorphic
```

## Tasks

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Allow client to support custom Promises and request handling
- [ ] Unit tests in both node and browser
